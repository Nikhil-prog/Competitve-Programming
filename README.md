Hi! Myself is Nikhil. Glad to catch your attention :)

Welcome to the Competitive Programming (Data Structures and Algorithms) Templates Repository! This repository is a collection of handcrafted templates for various DSA concepts, designed to streamline your coding journey. I post templates of the Data structures/algorithm I write while learning here.

For any discussion or question, feel free to Reach Out!

Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of computer science and play a crucial role in solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to:

- Provide well-organized, ready-to-use DSA templates.
- Offer a clean and structured codebase for learning and reference.
- Encourage collaboration and contributions from the community.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is designed to keep things organized and make it easy for you to find the DSA templates you need. Here's an overview:

- **Algorithms**: A collection of various algorithm templates.
- **Arrays**: Templates for common array-related algorithms.
- **Backtracking**: Templates for backtracking algorithms and problems.
- **Data Structures**: This folder houses general templates for different types of data structures.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Templates for solving problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Graph**: Templates for graph-related algorithms and data structures.
- **Heap**: Templates for heap data structures and algorithms.
- **Linked List**: Templates for singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, and other linked list variations.
- **Searching**: Templates for searching algorithms like binary search and linear search.
- **Sorting**: Templates for sorting algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, and more.
- **Stack and Queue**: Templates for stack and queue data structures and related algorithms.

The "Data Structures" folder serves as a central repository for various data structure templates. You'll find general templates for data structures, while more specific templates for trees and other data structures are organized into their respective folders.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can either clone it or simply browse the code online. Here's a quick guide on how to use these templates:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
