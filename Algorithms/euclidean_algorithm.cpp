Problem statement:

Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
The algorithm is based on the below facts.
1.If we subtract a smaller number from a larger (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
2.Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
